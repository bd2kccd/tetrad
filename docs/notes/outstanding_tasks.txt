List of tasks, updated af 3/21/07.

Tyler:

@ Allow updater to save its "state"?

@ Logging Stuff:
  - Graph manip log
  - Data needs to log the dataset (sample size, etc)
  - Make the log setup easier to understand.
  - Save log config states.
  - Updater should log something.

@ Implement the ION algorithm.

@ Add to simulation dialogs an option for including coltData from latent variables.

@ Add popup displays of triad classifications for relevant
algorithms. E.g., in CPC if you have X-->Y<--Z, W-->Z, it may be that
according to sepsets W---Y---Z is unfaithful, despite how it
appears. (Joe)

@ Save/load Bayes nets in BIF format.

@ Modify graph comparator so that it shows differences between two graphs
only (and doesn't do a series of graph comparisons).


Other:

@ Begin the task of implementing better, more systematic unit tests of
all algorithm pieces.

@ Do simulation tests for the EM estimator.

@ Implement the score-based PAG search.

@ Double check consistency of SEM code with itself and against other
SEM software.

 - Check against the sem package in R.

@ Fix the Prediction Editor and think of what do calculus
functionality can be incorporated into Tetrad. (Peter will think about
this.)

@ Add a continuous "classifier," as a looping over cases of a dataset
predicting continuous values for those cases, with statistics. Use
regression and the continuous updater.

@ Improve the Compare box so that it does a better job of making
useful comparisons between graphs of the sort that we want. (Skip this
for now.)

@ Add all relevant examples from CPS to website as sessions. (Peter)

@ Make sample sessions illustrating use of Tetrad boxes and post on
website. (Peter)

@ Write down input/output/pseudocode for Mimbuild-type algorithms.

@ Write down formula (algorithm??) for Gaussian BIC in Mimbuild.
