This library release of Tetrad includes all of the algorithmic code
in the edu.cmu.tetrad packages of the Tetrad repository. It should be
self-contained. The contents of the zip file are as follows:

tetrad/src        All of the source files for the package edu.cmu.tetrad
                  in Tetrad.

tetrad/lib        All of the jars that the source files in tetrad/src
                  depend on.

tetrad/javadoc    Javadocs for all of the files in tetrad/src

tetrad/tetrad.jar A library jar consisting of compilations of all of
                  source files in tetrad/src and all of the contents
                  of the jars in tetrad/lib.

The javadocs may be unhelpful in points, and the code may contain
bugs. If you notice any, please email me at:

That said, most of the code included has been in use for some time now
and should be relatively stable at this point. If you have any
questions about specific pieces of code, you can email me and I
will tell you the truth.
