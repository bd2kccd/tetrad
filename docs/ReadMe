Directory "archives":

This directory contains serialization archives generated by the
TestSerializability unit test when the 'archive' Ant task is
executed. This is executed each time a new version of Tetrad is
published. Please do not delete these archives; they are needed
to ensure that Tetrad sessions saved out with old versions of
Tetrad will load for later versions of Tetrad.

When new versions of Tetrad are published, please make sure to
cvs add -kb these archives to CVS.

The TestSerializability unit test will always check deserialization
of the files in archives in this directory. Any problems found
by that test when loading serializable exemplars from the archives
in this directory must be fixed in the code before a new version
of Tetrad is published.
