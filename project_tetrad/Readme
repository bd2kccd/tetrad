If you would like to check out Tetrad from the command line, follow this example:

svn checkout svn+ssh://[username]@www.phil.cmu.edu/home/svnroot/tetrad/trunk tetrad

This assumes you have svn installed. If you don't have svn installed and are on
a linux machine, then grab it from the cloud. If you are on Windows, do a full
install of Cygwin. If you are on a mac you have it. OR ignore all of that,
install Intellij first, and use the Subversion checkout in Intellij. You
can do this by selecting Version Control--> Checkout from Version Control
and substituting the relevant pieces of the above command into the interface
holes. Make sure you check out the trunk; otherwise you will get a lot of
useless branches, and then what will you do. (You will delete your checkout
and try again, checking out the trunk.)

You will also need to check out and install the latest Java SDK from SUN,
which you can get at java.sun.com, unless you have a Mac, in which case you just
select Software Update. Make sure you figure out where it installed to; you
will need this.

Tetrad is set up to be loaded and run in Intellij IDEA (v. 8.1.3 currently,
4/27/2007). After you've obtained the code etc. in the .../tetrad directory,
to set it up in IDEA do the following:

1. File-->New Project from Scratch, if you checked it out already.

2. Fill in:

    * Name = Tetrad
    * Project File Location = path to the .../tetrad directory.

3. Accept all default to the end of the form, click Finish.

4. Click File-->Project Structure.

5. For the project SDK, create a "new" one. This is where you need to
put the location of the SDK (or JDK, same thing).

6. Click Ant Build on the right border. Click the little plus.
Select .../tetrad/build.xml. When it appears in the Ant Build columns,
right click on it. Select Properties.  Click Additional Classpath.
Add all the jars in /tetrad/lib.

10. Double click the compile target in Ant to run it.

11. Click on Project Structure again, then on Modules, then on Paths.
Click "Use Module Compile Output Path" and put the path to this file:

    /home/jdramsey/proj/tetrad/build/tetrad/classes

or whatever that is relative to your machine.

That should be enough to get started. You can compile using either
Ant or the Build menu in Intellij. If you want to launch the GUI, then
run the copyresources target in Ant, then launch away. (This assume you
followed the instructions so far and didn't just wing it. *wink*)
